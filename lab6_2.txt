#slope is zero if the p value for the slope var is large but it is really small, thereofre we reject the null hypothesis
#intercept is zero if the p value for it is bigger than 5% which isn't therefore reject the null hypothesis
#the total variation explained by the modell is 81.43% which is guite good therefore the model fits well. 81.43% of the data are explained by our model

#We use the F-statistic to test the null hypothesis that our model is not better than
a model containing intercept. Since the p-value corresponding to the F-statistic is
2.04713229884987e-33, which is very small, we confidently reject the null hypothesis
and conclude that our model is better than the model containing only intercept and
#we use F stat to test the null hypo that our modell is not better than a modell containng intercept. since the p value corresoinding to the F-statistic is small, we confidently reject the null hypo. and conclude that our model is botter than the model containg only intercept so our model is useful
